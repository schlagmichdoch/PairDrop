# Deployment Notes
The easiest way to get PairDrop up and running is by using Docker.

> <b>TURN server for Internet Transfer</b>
> 
> Beware that you have to host your own TURN server to enable transfers between different networks.
>
> Follow [this guide](https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/turn-server/) to either install coturn directly on your system (Step 1) \
> or deploy it via docker-compose (Step 5).

> <b>PairDrop via HTTPS</b>
> 
> On some browsers PairDrop must be served over TLS in order for some feautures to work properly. These may include copying an incoming message via the 'copy' button, installing PairDrop as PWA, persistent pairing of devices and changing of the display name, and notifications. Naturally, this is also recommended to increase security.

## Deployment with Docker

### Docker Image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped --name=pairdrop -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 lscr.io/linuxserver/pairdrop
```

> You must use a server proxy to set the X-Forwarded-For \
> to prevent all clients from discovering each other (See [#HTTP-Server](#http-server)).
>
> To prevent bypassing the proxy by reaching the docker container directly, \
> `127.0.0.1` is specified in the run command.

#### Options / Flags
Set options by using the following flags in the `docker run` command:

##### Port
```bash
-p 127.0.0.1:8080:3000
```
> Specify the port used by the docker image 
> - 3000 -> `-p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000`
> - 8080 -> `-p 127.0.0.1:8080:3000`
##### Rate limiting requests
```bash
-e RATE_LIMIT=true
```
> Limits clients to 1000 requests per 5 min

##### IPv6 Localization
```bash
-e IPV6_LOCALIZE=4
```
> To enable Peer Discovery among IPv6 peers, you can specify a reduced number of segments \
> of the client IPv6 address to be evaluated as the peer's IP. \
> This can be especially useful when using Cloudflare as a proxy.
> 
> The flag must be set to an **integer** between `1` and `7`. \
> The number represents the number of IPv6 [hextets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Address_representation) \
> to match the client IP against. The most common value would be `4`, \
> which will group peers within the same `/64` subnet.

##### Websocket Fallback (for VPN)
```bash
-e WS_FALLBACK=true
```
> Provides PairDrop to clients with an included websocket fallback \
> if the peer to peer WebRTC connection is not available to the client.
>
> This is not used on the official https://pairdrop.net website, \
> but you can activate it on your self-hosted instance.
> This is especially useful if you connect to your instance via a VPN (as most VPN services block WebRTC completely in order to hide your real IP address). ([Read more here](https://privacysavvy.com/security/safe-browsing/disable-webrtc-chrome-firefox-safari-opera-edge/)).
>
> **Warning:** All traffic sent between devices using this fallback \
> is routed through the server and therefor not peer to peer! \
> Beware that the traffic routed via this fallback is readable by the server. \
> Only ever use this on instances you can trust. \
> Additionally, beware that all traffic using this fallback debits the servers data plan.

##### Specify STUN/TURN Servers
```bash
-e RTC_CONFIG="rtc_config.json"
```

> Specify the STUN/TURN servers PairDrop clients use by setting \
> `RTC_CONFIG` to a JSON file including the configuration. \
> You can use `pairdrop/rtc_config_example.json` as a starting point.
>
> To host your own TURN server you can follow this guide: https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/turn-server/
> Alternatively, use a free, pre-configured TURN server like [OpenRelay]([url](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/))
>
> Default configuration:
> ```json
> {
>   "sdpSemantics": "unified-plan",
>   "iceServers": [
>     {
>       "urls": "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```

##### Debug Mode
```bash
-e DEBUG_MODE="true"
```

> Use this flag to enable debugging information about the connecting peers IP addresses. \
> This is quite useful to check whether the [#HTTP-Server](#http-server) \
> is configured correctly, so the auto-discovery feature works correctly. \
> Otherwise, all clients discover each other mutually, independently of their network status.
> 
> If this flag is set to `"true"` each peer that connects to the PairDrop server will produce a log to STDOUT like this:
> ```
> ----DEBUGGING-PEER-IP-START----
> remoteAddress: ::ffff:172.17.0.1
> x-forwarded-for: 19.117.63.126
> cf-connecting-ip: undefined
> PairDrop uses: 19.117.63.126
> IP is private: false
> if IP is private, '127.0.0.1' is used instead
> ----DEBUGGING-PEER-IP-END----
> ```
> If the IP PairDrop uses is the public IP of your device, everything is set up correctly. \ 
>To find out your devices public IP visit https://www.whatismyip.com/.
> 
> To preserve your clients' privacy, **never use this flag in production!**

### Docker Image from GHCR
```bash
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped --name=pairdrop -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 ghcr.io/schlagmichdoch/pairdrop npm run start:prod 
```
> You must use a server proxy to set the X-Forwarded-For to prevent \
> all clients from discovering each other (See [#HTTP-Server](#http-server)).
>
> To prevent bypassing the proxy by reaching the Docker container directly, \
> `127.0.0.1` is specified in the run command.
>
> To specify options replace `npm run start:prod` \
> according to [the documentation below.](#options--flags-1)

> The Docker Image includes a healthcheck. \
> Read more about [Docker Swarm Usage](docker-swarm-usage.md#docker-swarm-usage).

### Docker Image self-built

## Deployment with Docker Compose
Here's an example docker-compose file:

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
    pairdrop:
        image: lscr.io/linuxserver/pairdrop:latest
        container_name: pairdrop
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            - PUID=1000 # UID to run the application as
            - PGID=1000 # GID to run the application as
            - WS_FALLBACK=false # Set to true to enable websocket fallback if the peer to peer WebRTC connection is not available to the client.
            - RATE_LIMIT=false # Set to true to limit clients to 1000 requests per 5 min.
            - TZ=Etc/UTC # Time Zone
        ports:
            - 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 # Web UI
```

Run the compose file with `docker compose up -d`.

> You must use a server proxy to set the X-Forwarded-For \
> to prevent all clients from discovering each other (See [#HTTP-Server](#http-server)).
>
> To prevent bypassing the proxy by reaching the Docker container \
> directly, `127.0.0.1` is specified in the run command.

### Options / Flags
#### Local Run
```bash
npm start -- --localhost-only
```
> Only allow connections from localhost.
> 
> You must use a server proxy to set the X-Forwarded-For \
> to prevent all clients from discovering each other (See [#HTTP-Server](#http-server)).
>
> Use this when deploying PairDrop with node to prevent \
> bypassing the proxy by reaching the Docker container directly.

#### Automatic restart on error
```bash
npm start -- --auto-restart 
```
> Restarts server automatically on error

<br>

#### Rate limiting requests
```bash
npm start -- --rate-limit 
```
> Limits clients to 1000 requests per 5 min

<br>

#### Websocket Fallback (for VPN)
```bash
npm start -- --include-ws-fallback
```
> Provides PairDrop to clients with an included websocket fallback \
> if the peer to peer WebRTC connection is not available to the client.
>
> This is not used on the official https://pairdrop.net, \

> Additionally, beware that all traffic using this fallback debits the servers data plan.

<br>

#### Production (autostart and rate-limit)
```bash
npm run start:prod
```

#### Production (autostart, rate-limit, localhost-only and websocket fallback for VPN)
```bash
npm run start:prod -- --localhost-only --include-ws-fallback
```
> To prevent connections to the node server from bypassing \
> the proxy server you should always use "--localhost-only" on production.

## HTTP-Server
When running PairDrop, the `X-Forwarded-For` header has to be set by a proxy. \
Otherwise, all clients will be mutually visible.

To check if your setup is configured correctly [use the environment variable `DEBUG_MODE="true"`](#debug-mode).

### Using nginx
#### Allow http and https requests
```
server {
    listen       80;

    expires epoch;

    location / {
        proxy_connect_timeout 300;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-for $remote_addr;
    }
}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/pairdrop-dev.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/certs/pairdrop-dev.key;

    expires epoch;

    location / {
        proxy_connect_timeout 300;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-for $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

#### Automatic http to https redirect:
```
server {
    listen       80;

    expires epoch;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host:3000$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/pairdrop-dev.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/certs/pairdrop-dev.key;

    expires epoch;

    location / {
        proxy_connect_timeout 300;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-for $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

### Using Apache
install modules `proxy`, `proxy_http`, `mod_proxy_wstunnel`
```bash
a2enmod proxy
```
```bash
a2enmod proxy_http
```
```bash
a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
```

<br>

Create a new configuration file under `/etc/apache2/sites-available` (on Debian)

**pairdrop.conf**
#### Allow HTTP and HTTPS requests
```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>	
	ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
	RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://127.0.0.1:3000/$1" [P,L]
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:443>	
	ProxyPass / https://127.0.0.1:3000/
	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
	RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "wws://127.0.0.1:3000/$1" [P,L]
</VirtualHost>
```
#### Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect:
```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>	
   Redirect permanent / https://127.0.0.1:3000/
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:443>	
	ProxyPass / https://127.0.0.1:3000/
	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
	RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "wws://127.0.0.1:3000/$1" [P,L]
</VirtualHost>
```
Activate the new virtual host and reload Apache:
```bash
a2ensite pairdrop
```
```bash
service apache2 reload
```

# Local Development
## Install
All files needed for developing are available on the branch `dev`.

First, [Install docker with docker-compose.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Then, clone the repository and run docker-compose:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop.git

    cd PairDrop

    git checkout dev
    
    docker-compose up -d
```
Now point your web browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

- To restart the containers, run `docker-compose restart`.
- To stop the containers, run `docker-compose stop`.
- To debug the NodeJS server, run `docker logs pairdrop_node_1`.

<br>

# Coturn
## docker-compose

- generate or retrieve certificates for your <DOMAIN> (f.e. letsencrypt)
- copy your ssl-certificates and privkey to `./ssl` and `chown -R nobody:nogroup ./ssl`
- create a dh-params file with `openssl dhparam -out ./ssl/dhparams.pem 4096`
- copy `rtc_config_example-coturn.json` to `rtc_config.json`
- copy `turnserver_example.conf` to `turnserver.conf`
- change <DOMAIN> in all 2 files to the domain, where your pairdrop is running
- change user and password for turn-server in `turnserver.conf` and `rtc-config.json`
- To start the container including coturn run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-coturn.yml up -d`
- To restart the container including coturn run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-coturn.yml restart`
- To stop the container including coturn run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-coturn.yml stop`

## Firewall
To run PairDrop including its own coturn-server you need to punch holes in the firewall. These ports must be opened additionally:
- 3478 tcp/udp
- 5349 tcp/udp
- 10000:20000 tcp/udp

## Testing PWA related features
PWAs requires the app to be served under a correctly set up and trusted TLS endpoint.

The NGINX container creates a CA certificate and a website certificate for you. \
To correctly set the common name of the certificate, \
you need to change the FQDN environment variable in `docker/fqdn.env` \
to the fully qualified domain name of your workstation.

If you want to test PWA features, you need to trust the CA of the certificate for your local deployment. \
For your convenience, you can download the crt file from `http://<Your FQDN>:8080/ca.crt`. \
Install that certificate to the trust store of your operating system. \
- On Windows, make sure to install it to the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store. \
- On macOS, double-click the installed CA certificate in `Keychain Access`, \
- expand `Trust`, and select `Always Trust` for SSL. \
- Firefox uses its own trust store. To install the CA, \
- point Firefox at `http://<Your FQDN>:8080/ca.crt`. \
- When prompted, select `Trust this CA to identify websites` and click *OK*. \
- When using Chrome, you need to restart Chrome so it reloads the trust store (`chrome://restart`). \
- Additionally, after installing a new cert, \
- you need to clear the Storage (DevTools → Application → Clear storage → Clear site data).

Please note that the certificates (CA and webserver cert) expire after a day.
Also, whenever you restart the NGINX Docker, container new certificates are created.

The site is served on `https://<Your FQDN>:8443`.
