## Differences to the [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop) it is based on
<details><summary>List view</summary>

### Paired Devices and Public Rooms â€” Internet Transfer
* Transfer files over the Internet between paired devices or by entering temporary public rooms.
* Connect to devices in complex network environments (public Wi-Fi, company network, iCloud Private Relay, VPN, etc.).
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices outside of your local network that are behind a NAT are auto-connected via the PairDrop TURN server.
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices from the local network, in the same public room, or previously paired are shown.

#### Persistent Device Pairing

Always connect to known devices

* Pair devices via a 6-digit code or a QR-Code.
* Paired devices always find each other via shared secrets independently of their local network. 
* Pairing is persistent. You find your devices even after reopening PairDrop.
* You can edit and unpair devices easily.

#### Temporary Public Rooms

Connect to others in complex network situations, or over the Internet.

* Enter a public room via a 5-letter code or a QR-code.
* Enter a public room to temporarily connect to devices outside your local network.
* All devices in the same public room see each other.
* Public rooms are temporary. Closing PairDrop  leaves all rooms.

### [Improved UI for Sending/Receiving Files](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/issues/560)
* Files are transferred after a request is accepted. Files are auto-downloaded upon completing a transfer, if possible.
* Multiple files are downloaded as a ZIP file
* Download, share or save to gallery via the "Share" menu on Android and iOS.
* Multiple files are transferred at once with an overall progress indicator.

### Send Files or Text Directly From Share Menu, Context Menu or CLI
* [Send files directly from context menu on Ubuntu (using Nautilus)](docs/how-to.md#send-multiple-files-and-directories-directly-from-context-menu-on-ubuntu-using-nautilus)
* [Send files directly from the context menu on Windows](docs/how-to.md#send-files-directly-from-context-menu-on-windows)
* [Send directly from the "Share" menu on iOS](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-ios)
* [Send directly from the "Share" menu on Android](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-android)
* [Send directly via the command-line interface](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-via-command-line-interface)

### Other Changes
* Change your display name to easily differentiate your devices.
* [Paste files/text and choose the recipient afterwards ](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/534)
* [Prevent devices from sleeping on file transfer](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/413)
* Warn user before PairDrop is closed on file transfer
* Open PairDrop on multiple tabs simultaneously (Thanks [@willstott101](https://github.com/willstott101))
* [Video and audio preview](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/455) (Thanks [@victorwads](https://github.com/victorwads))
* Switch theme back to auto/system after dark or light mode is on

* To host PairDrop on your local network (e.g. on Raspberry Pi): [All peers connected with private IPs are discoverable by each other](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/558)
* When hosting PairDrop yourself, you can [set your own STUN/TURN servers](docs/host-your-own.md#specify-stunturn-servers)
