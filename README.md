## Differences to Snapdrop
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

### Paired Devices and Public Rooms - Internet Transfer
* Transfer files over the internet between paired devices or by entering temporary public rooms.
* Connect to devices in complex network environments (public Wi-Fi, company network, Apple Private Relay, VPN etc.).
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices outside your local network that are behind a NAT are connected automatically via the PairDrop TURN server.
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* You will always discover devices on your local network. Paired devices and devices in the same public room are shown additionally.

#### Persistent Device Pairing
* Pair your devices via a 6-digit code or a QR-Code.
* Paired devices will always find each other via shared secrets independently of their local network. 
* Paired devices are persistent. You find your devices even after reopening PairDrop.
* You can edit and unpair devices easily
* Ideal to always connect easily to your own devices

#### Temporary Public Rooms
* Enter a public room via a 5-letter code or a QR-Code.
* Enter a public room to temporarily connect to devices outside your local network.
* All devices in the same public room see each other mutually.
* Public rooms are temporary. Public rooms are left as soon as PairDrop is closed.
* Ideal to connect easily to others in complex network situations or over the internet.

### [Improved UI for sending/receiving files](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/issues/560)
* Files are transferred only after a request is accepted first. On transfer completion files are downloaded automatically if possible.
* Multiple files are downloaded as a ZIP file
* On iOS and Android, in addition to downloading, files can be shared or saved to the gallery via the Share menu.
* Multiple files are transferred at once with an overall progress indicator

### Send Files or Text Directly From Share Menu, Context Menu or CLI
* [Send files directly from context menu on Windows](docs/how-to.md#send-multiple-files-and-directories-directly-from-context-menu-on-windows)
* [Send files directly from context menu on Ubuntu (using Nautilus)](/docs/how-to.md#send-multiple-files-and-directories-directly-from-context-menu-on-ubuntu-using-nautilus)
* [Send files directly from share menu on iOS](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-ios)
* [Send files directly from share menu on Android](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-android)
* [Send files directly via command-line interface](docs/how-to.md#send-directly-via-command-line-interface)
